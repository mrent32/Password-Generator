# Password Generator Starter Code
Random Password Generator Project.
This application uses JS to create a password generator for the purpose of having strong password security across your accounts. 
It takes concepts we have learned in bootcamp such as If statements, arrays, functions, and variables and applies them in a useful way.
Having a strong password that is not easily broken by other humans is a great advantage, 
and for this reason we wanted to create this application, as well as being able to replicate the material we have been learning so far.
